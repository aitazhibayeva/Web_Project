# Online Restaurant WebApp: AUYL

We're using Django for the backend, which manages data, user authentication, and handles requests. For the frontend, we've opted for Angular, creating a dynamic and interactive interface. This setup enables smooth navigation of the restaurant's menu, adding items to the cart, and placing orders online. By combining Django and Angular, we're ensuring an effective solution for managing online orders for the restaurant.

In our web application, customers have the freedom to:
* Explore our diverse menu offerings and effortlessly add their desired items to their virtual cart.
* Customize their selections by adding toppings and extras as desired.
* When ready, they can proceed to finalize their order and place it with us.


Once an order is submitted, the items will be automatically removed from the current cart. The site administrator gains access to the following functionalities:
* View incoming orders through the admin interface and mark them as completed upon fulfillment.
* Modify or update product categories and names as necessary to ensure accurate representation on the menu.
